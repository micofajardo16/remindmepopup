# remindmepopup

python file with tkinter to remind me to fix my posture, mew, and relax my eyes every x seconds (inputs from user)

improvements:
- sound for every pop-up so its much more annoying
- icons so that it doesnt look like dog shit
- custom adding of reminders (holy fuk how)
- creating class for root window instead of it running on the main method
	- but this is ok for now since it pops up just once
	- helpful for changing values i guess? no need to re-run?
- auto run after windows/linux start-up
- show in system tray for windows + other actions there i guess
	- way to exit the program without waiting for a pop-up
